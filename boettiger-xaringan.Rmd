> The real goal of fisheries management is to avoid finding out what the stock-recruitment relationship is. Once you have depleted the stock enough to know, it’s probably too late

--John Shepard, from an argument with David Cushing, ca 1980

# How do we manage what we cannot measure?

# We include uncertainties in our *models* but not *decisions*

## A long-standing paradox

> An important tacit assumption in Reed’s analysis, as in the other works referred
to above, is that the recruitment level X is known accurately prior to the harvest decision, [...] In the case of fishery resources, the stock level X is almost never known very accurately, owing to the difficulty of observing fish in their natural environment.

## A Tough Problem

> For reasons of tractability, we shall adopt the simplifying assumption that the escapement level S, is known exactly at the end of that period. (The mathematical difficulty
of the problem increases markedly if this assumption is
relaxed.)

> The above results appear to contradict the conventional wisdom of renewable resource management, under which high uncertainty would call for increased
caution in the setting of quotas.

# Simulation

# There is no fixed "policy"

--

Must also know your prior belief

in other words, must know prior _complete history_ of observations

# Appendix: Age structure

--

- Larval only density dependence -> MSY solution, harvest only on most valuable age class (Reed 1980, Getz 1980)

-- 

- Age+stage structured may not be an MSY (cyclical escapement, still an average $B_{\text{MSY}}$)

--

- Stochastic age-structured models: also support either larger or smaller harvest than the deterministic equivalent, but still at a constant escapement policy
