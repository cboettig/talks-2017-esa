> The real goal of fisheries management is to avoid finding out what the stock-recruitment relationship is. Once you have depleted the stock enough to know, itâ€™s probably too late

--John Shepard, from an argument with David Cushing, ca 1980

# How do we manage what we cannot measure?

# Uncertainty in Models but not Decisions

# MSY: a sticky idea

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
r <- 1
K <- 100
H <- 0
logistic <- function(N) r * N * (1 - N / K) - H

data_frame(population_size = 0:100, 
           growth_rate = logistic(population_size)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(population_size, growth_rate)) + 
  geom_path(col="white", size=2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = K/2), lty = "dashed", col = "white", size = 1.5)

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = \underbrace{r N \left(1 - \frac{N}{K} \right)}_{f(N)} - H$$
$$H_{\text{MSY}} = f(N) = r K / 4$$
$$B_{\text{MSY}} = K/2 $$

# Stochastic Models (Reed 1979)

$$ N_{t+1} = z_t^g f(N_t - H_t)$$


"Constant Escapement"

$$S = B_{\text{MSY}}$$


---

# An aside: Age structure

- Larval only density dependence -> MSY solution, harvest only on most valuable age class (Reed 1980, Getz 1980)
- Age+stage structured may not be an MSY (cyclical escapement, still an average $B_{\text{MSY}}$)
- Stochastic age-structured models: also support either larger or smaller harvest than the deterministic equivalent, but   still at a constant escapement policy

# Decisions vs Models

# How should we accomodate observational uncertainty?

## A long-standing paradox?

caution in the setting of quotas.

## A Tough Problem

> For reasons of tractability, we shall adopt the simplifying assumption that the escapement level S, is known exactly at the end of that period. (The mathematical difficulty
of the problem increases markedly if this assumption is
relaxed.)

# POMDPs: Tracking the Belief State

# (Prior) Beliefs matter

-- 

## the "paradox" applies only to amnesiac manager

--

or a manager with strong prior belief that the stock is larger than the most recent observation would suggest.

---

# There is no "policy"

--

Must also know your prior belief

--

or rather, must know prior _complete history_ of observations
