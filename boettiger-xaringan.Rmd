> "The real goal of fisheries management is to avoid finding out what the stock-recruitment relationship is. Once you have depleted the stock enough to know, itâ€™s probably too late""

-John Shepard, from an argument with David Cushing, ca 1980

# How do we manage what we cannot measure?

# Classic MSY

![](img/msy.jpg)

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = \underbrace{r N \left(1 - \frac{N}{K} \right)}_{f(N)} - H$$
$$H_{\text{MSY}} = f(N) = r K / 4$$
$$B_{\text{MSY}} = K/2 $$


---

# Stochastic Models (Reed 1979)

$$ N_{t+1} = z_t^g f(N_t - H_t)$$


"Constant Escapement"

$$S = B_{\text{MSY}}$$


---

# An aside: Age structure

- Larval only density dependence -> MSY solution, harvest only on most valuable age class (Reed 1980, Getz 1980)
- Age+stage structured may not be an MSY (cyclical escapement, still an average $B_{\text{MSY}}$)
- Stochastic age-structured models: also support either larger or smaller harvest than the deterministic equivalent, but   still at a constant escapement policy
